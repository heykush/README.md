I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some projects I enjoy working with include Python(Automation, APIs + Web Scraping) and HTML. I recently started my Python Page <a href="https://www.instagram.com/python.trick/">@python.trick 🌟</a> can join us in our python community.  My interest in the Making Bots led me to make this project <a href="https://github.com/heykush/My-Assistant">Google Assistant</a>, a window virtual assistant to help you make this world more beautiful.
